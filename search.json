    "text": "Motivation\nIn recent months, the Trump administration has announced significant expansions to immigration enforcement efforts, particularly within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agencies under the Department of Homeland Security. Given the controversial nature of these changes and the fact that we are just three months into Trump’s return to office, this project aims to better understand their implications by analyzing trends in immigration enforcement. We analyze book-in and length of stay data from fiscal years 2017 through 2024 to place current developments in historical context and assess how prior enforcement patterns may inform present concerns. By studying the recent history of ICE and CBP, we aim to better understand the potential consequences of recent policy shifts.\nOur research questions are:\n\nWhat do detention trends from the fiscal years 2017-2024 look like?\nWhat are the detention trends of 2019 specifically? Why was this a unique year?\nWhat are the current detention trends for FY2025?",

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn the United States, our immigration enforcement system involves multiple federal agencies, most importantly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), both under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). ICE is tasked with interior immigration enforcement and oversees the detention and removal of individuals already present in the United States. While CBP is responsible for securing U.S. borders and inspecting individuals at ports of entry. While CBP apprehends unauthorized individuals attempting to cross the border, ICE may detain individuals for longer-term detention and deportation proceedings.\nThe U.S. immigration detention regime has evolved significantly over the last several presidential administrations, reflecting broader political shifts in immigration policy. Under the Trump administration (2017–2021), immigration enforcement expanded rapidly, marked by increased arrests, prolonged detention periods, and controversial practices such as family separation. The Biden administration sought to scale back enforcement priorities and reduce reliance on detention, though results were mixed. As Trump returns to office in 2025, his administration has begun to reimplement and expand aggressive enforcement measures.\nFiscal Year (FY): The data in our project is organized by fiscal years, which span from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. This is important to keep in mind, as many people assume data corresponds to the calendar year (January to December). The fiscal year structure can also complicate interpretations of presidential policy impacts, since administrations change in January.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (or ICE): ICE is a federal agency responsible for interior immigration enforcement, including the arrest, detention, and removal of noncitizens within the United States.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP): CBP is the agency tasked with enforcing immigration and customs laws at U.S. borders and ports of entry.\n“Other Immigration Violator”: This category, used in detention data, can be misleading or not immediately clea. Despite its potentially criminal connotation, it refers to individuals without criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. These are civil immigration violators, such as those who overstayed a visa or entered the U.S. without authorization but are not being prosecuted for a separate criminal offense.",

    "section": "Data Collection",
    "text": "Data Collection\nThe ICE Detention Statistics collect crucial information for understanding and visualizing trends within the detention system. Our analysis focuses on key variables consistently tracked across multiple years, including the Number of Book-Ins, representing the total admissions into ICE detention facilities during a specific period. Criminality, which details the primary reasons for detention through various categories of criminal offenses or immigration violations, is also a core element. The Length of Stay, or the duration individuals spend in custody, and the Detention Population, indicating the number of individuals held at a given time, are essential metrics. Furthermore, the Facility Type, specifying the kind of detention center, and the Apprehending Agency, identifying whether ICE or CBP initially apprehended the individual, provide important context. Finally, the Month and Year of the data allow for meaningful temporal analysis of these trends. While specific categories within these variables might evolve slightly over time, these core elements remain consistent for our analysis.\nThe data is collected continuously as individuals are apprehended, processed, and detained by ICE. However, the publicly available datasets are compiled and released on a fiscal year (FY) basis. Each dataset covers the period from October 1st of the previous calendar year to September 30th of the current calendar year. For example, the “FY 2024 Detention Statistics” covers October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\nThe data is presumably collected for a wide variety of reasons. The U.S. government, and it’s agencies, collect so much data to monitor and quantify their actions. Data collection helps ICE track who is in custody, manage capacity across facilities, and allocate resources like staffing and funding. The data also serves broader purposes, including informing policy decisions, evaluating the impact of enforcement practices, and providing transparency to Congress, other oversight entities, and us (the public).\nWhile we don’t know all the details about how the data is collected, it likely originates through a combination of manual entry and electronic systems as individuals move through the immigration enforcement process. ICE personnel likely have to track information during apprehension, processing, and detention. This information is likely managed through robust systems.\nThe data was collected by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), primarily through its sub-agency Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). Additionaly, man ICE personnel are involved in the collection, including officers who apprehend and process individuals, detention facility staff who manage records, and administrative staff who enter and maintain data in ICE’s systems. Data analysts later compile this information for reporting and oversight.",

    "text": "Commentary\nTrump’s first term spanned from 2017 to 2020, followed by Biden’s presidency from 2021 to 2024. According to arrest data from ICE.gov, 2019 stands out as a particularly significant year, with over 500,000 arrests—nearly double the second-highest year, 2022, during Biden’s term. This surge in 2019 coincided with a series of aggressive policy changes under the Trump administration aimed at mass deportations and intensified border enforcement. The sharp drop in arrests in 2020—to around 200,000—was likely driven more by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic than by any policy shift, as public health measures and travel restrictions disrupted enforcement operations.\nGiven this context, 2019 offers the clearest view into the full impact of Trump-era immigration enforcement policies, free from the external disruptions seen in 2020. While the Biden administration did not see low arrest numbers—averaging around 300,000 per year—this level of enforcement appears more stable and less extreme compared to the peak under Trump. The data suggests that Trump’s administration facilitated a particularly aggressive spike in arrests, reflective of its hardline immigration stance.\n\n\n\n\nBook-Ins/Arrests by Criminality",

    "text": "Commentary\nWhile ICE does not provide much publicly available demographic data, it does report arrest data by “criminality” status. We chose to facet our analysis by this variable—not only because it is emphasized by ICE itself, but also because it aligns with common rhetoric from the Trump administration, which has frequently portrayed undocumented immigrants as criminals.\nHowever, the data challenges this narrative. In nearly every fiscal year we examined (with the exception of 2020, which was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic), the largest category of arrests involved individuals classified as having “no known criminal charges” or labeled as “other immigration violators.” The latter is a term often used to describe individuals whose only offense is a civil violation of U.S. immigration law—not a criminal conviction.\nBy framing immigrants as criminals, the Trump administration sought to position immigration enforcement as a matter of public safety and law enforcement. But the data tells a different story: the vast majority of those arrested do not fit the profile of dangerous criminals. This disconnect underscores the importance of critically examining how enforcement policies are justified and who they actually target.\n\n\n# A tibble: 747 × 5\n    Year Month Agency          Criminality                `Length of Stay`\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  2018 Oct   CBP             Convicted Criminal                     27.4\n 2  2018 Oct   CBP             Pending Criminal Charges               37.6\n 3  2018 Oct   CBP             Other Immigration Violator             24.4\n 4  2018 Oct   ICE             Convicted Criminal                     54.9\n 5  2018 Oct   ICE             Pending Criminal Charges               50.3\n 6  2018 Oct   ICE             Other Immigration Violator             50.3\n 7  2018 Oct   Overall Average Convicted Criminal                     43.7\n 8  2018 Oct   Overall Average Pending Criminal Charges               48.1\n 9  2018 Oct   Overall Average Other Immigration Violator             25.8\n10  2018 Nov   CBP             Convicted Criminal                     29  \n# ℹ 737 more rows",

While ICE maintained relatively consistent levels of Book-Ins throughout the year, CBP experienced a significant spike between March and May. This surge likely reflects a shift in border enforcement policy rather than changes in deportation practices. The timing and nature of this increase align with the Trump administration’s heightened focus on the U.S.–Mexico border during his first term. These trends suggest that resources and enforcement efforts during this period were disproportionately directed toward CBP, while ICE operations remained more stable.\n\n\n [1] \"IGSA\"                \"Hold\"                \"Juvenile\"           \n [4] \"Other\"               \"DIGSA\"               \"CDF / DIGSA\"        \n [7] \"Family\"              \"Hospital\"            \"USMS IGA\"           \n[10] \"NOT DEFINED\"         \"BOP\"                 \"Staging\"            \n[13] \"SPC\"                 \"CDF\"                 \"DIGSA / Family\"     \n[16] \"IGSA / USMS IGA\"     \"DIGSA / IGSA\"        \"USMS CDF\"           \n[19] \"USMS CDF / USMS IGA\"\n\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 2\n   type_detailed           n\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n 1 IGSA                  386\n 2 USMS IGA              202\n 3 Hold                  174\n 4 Hospital               87\n 5 NOT DEFINED            59\n 6 Other                  49\n 7 BOP                    43\n 8 Juvenile               27\n 9 DIGSA                  22\n10 CDF                    13\n11 Staging                 9\n12 SPC                     6\n13 Family                  5\n14 USMS CDF                2\n15 CDF / DIGSA             1\n16 DIGSA / Family          1\n17 DIGSA / IGSA            1\n18 IGSA / USMS IGA         1\n19 USMS CDF / USMS IGA     1\n\n\n[1] \"Adult\"    \"Adult\"    \"Juvenile\" \"Adult\"    \"Adult\"    \"Adult\"   \n\n\n\n   Adult   Family Hospital Juvenile \n     969        6       87       27 \n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  type_detailed     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adult           969\n2 Hospital         87\n3 Juvenile         27\n4 Family            6\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ICE Detention Trends - vera.org",

The geographic distribution of facilities reveals clear concentrations along the U.S.–Mexico border, the coasts, and in major metropolitan areas. Notably, there is a dense cluster of facilities both at the southern border and in the Northeastern U.S., underscoring enforcement priorities in those regions.\nAnother key insight from the visualization involves the types of facilities. The original dataset—sourced from the Vera Institute’s ICE Detention Trends project—categorizes facilities not only by function but also by funding structure. Since our focus was on the operational role of the facilities rather than their funding sources, we simplified the categories to emphasize their core functions. In particular, we grouped most adult-serving facilities under the label “Adult.”\nThe distribution of family facilities is especially telling. All six family detention centers are located along the Texas–Mexico border, suggesting a deliberate strategy to process and detain immigrant families—especially those from Mexico and Central America—at the point of entry. Juvenile and hospital facilities were more geographically dispersed, with hospital facilities in particular spread across a wider range of states.",
